# Code name: Recipe App

I know, its very catchy! I can't think of a better name right now, so bare with me. I want to start creating a git-like version control system for recipes. I love cooking, I love coding: so why not try it out. I'm still relatively new to web development, so this is going to be way more of an effort to learn with the added benefit of being able to at the very least use it as a recipe storage application.

## The Idea

Experimenting is fun. It's why I originally liked biology and why I got into the wonderful world of coding. However, theres a fact that little other people know about me. That is: I also have a passion for food and cooking. Experimenting with cooking has always been hard for me. I always feel like I waste food by experimenting. That's why I want to create an application that will allow me to create a recipe and then experiment with it. I can sacrifice some food in the NAME OF SCIENCE!, and getting it down on paper is one way to make the sacrifice seem worthwhile. I know you can just do this in a notepad, or something similar, but It would be nice to have everything in an application that you can store, search and even rollback versions of a recipe.

Also, I want to add in a social feature to this. Github is an awesome way to collaborate experiment with code, as the whole world can watch you do it and even help you out when needed. More heads are better than one head. I'd like to hash out a feature like this as well.

## Agenda

* The first thing I want to do is create a generic recipe storage app with the ability to create and edit recipes

## Possible Technologies to use

The purpose of this app is, first and foremost, to learn. This is a list of technologies/concepts that I might want to explore, as they fit into the idea:
* First I need to choose what language I want the server to be in
	* Node (express or sails)
	* Ruby (most likely rails)
	* Python (I want to learn python, most notably flask or Django)
* I'd like to use heavy front-end javascript, with the thought of going into a front-end framework. I still need to figure out how to implement this into the idea as it has the feeling of a much more multipage app.
	* react.js
	* angular
	* ember
	* backbone
