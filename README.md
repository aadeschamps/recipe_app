# Code name: Recipe App

## Introduction

I know, its very catchy! I can't think of a better name right now, so bare with me. I want to start creating a git-like version control system for recipes. I love cooking, I love coding: so why not try it out. I'm still relatively new to web development, so this is going to be way more of an effort to learn with the added benefit of being able to at the very least use it as a recipe storage application.

## The Idea

Experimenting is fun. It's why I originally liked biology and why I got into the wonderful world of coding. However, theres a fact that little other people know about me. That is: I also have a passion for food and cooking. Experimenting with cooking has always been hard for me. I always feel like I waste food by experimenting. That's why I want to create an application that will allow me to create a recipe and then experiment with it. I can sacrifice some food in the NAME OF SCIENCE!, and getting it down on paper is one way to make the sacrifice seem worthwhile. I know you can just do this in a notepad, or something similar, but It would be nice to have everything in an application that you can store, search and even rollback versions of a recipe.

Also, I want to add in a social feature to this. Github is an awesome way to collaborate experiment with code, as the whole world can watch you do it and even help you out when needed. More heads are better than one head. I'd like to hash out a feature like this as well.

## User Stories: 

* A chef is able to store his recipes for later use
* A chef is able to log in and see his recipes
* A chef is able to create a new version of his recipes in order to experiment with them
* A chef is able to rollback changes when the new version doesnt work out
* A chef is able to see other chefs recipes to get ideas and to collaborate
* A chef is able to copy other chefs recipes into his own book
* A chef is able to make a "pull request" in order to suggest changes to a recipe

## Agenda

* The first thing I want to do is create a generic recipe storage app with the ability to create and edit recipes
* Maybe pull in recipes that you can use from API
* Share recipes with others
* "Fork" recipes with the ability to suggest to someone a way to better their recipe
* "Branch" recipes in git fashion
* Take notes on recipes "possibly a phone app that takes "

## Possible Technologies to use

The purpose of this app is, first and foremost, to learn. This is a list of technologies/concepts that I might want to explore, as they fit into the idea:
* First I need to choose what language I want the server to be in
	* Node (express or sails)
		* definitely most familiar with express
		* really like javascript
		* would like to be "cool"
		* would need to learn new ORM, would miss active records
		* definitely harder in terms of concepts
	* Ruby (most likely rails)
		* a lot of people like rails
		* active records is FANTASTIC
		* I'm not a huge fan of writing in ruby
		* does so much for you, I feel like im learning non-transferable skills
	* Python (I want to learn python, most notably flask or Django)
		* python is awesome
		* I'm very curious about it
		* its new to me, and so I feel like I should focus on mastering what I already have under my belt
* I'd like to use heavy front-end javascript, with the thought of going into a front-end framework. I still need to figure out how to implement this into the idea as it has the feeling of a much more multipage app.
	* react.js
	* angular
	* ember
	* backbone
